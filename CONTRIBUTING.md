### **Issues before PRs**

1. Before you start working on a change please make sure that there is an issue for what you will be working on. You can either find an [existing issue](https://github.com/tremorlabs/tremor/issues) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/tremorlabs/tremor/issues/new/choose) if none exists.
2. When you are ready to start working on a change you should first [fork the Tremor repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [branch out](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) from the `main` branch.

4. [Open a pull request towards the main branch in the Tremor repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Then, our team will review, comment and eventually approve your PR.
